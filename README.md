## üìà Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard developed in Power BI, designed to provide actionable insights into sales, revenue, profit, customer behavior, and organizational performance.

The dashboard is divided into the following sections:
1. **Navigation Bar**: Date filters and data refresh details.
2. **Sidebar**: Navigation between modules and notification alerts.
3. **Dashboard**: Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), interactive charts, and geographic visualizations.
4. **Statistics Module**: In-depth analysis of categories, budget allocations, profit margins, and state-wise order rankings.
